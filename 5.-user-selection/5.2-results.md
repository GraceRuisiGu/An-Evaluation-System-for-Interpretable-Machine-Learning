# 5.3 Results & Explanation

## 5.3.1 Score Table

According to our Evaluation System, we can easily get the score tables of _the Churn Notebook_ from the three criteria:

### 5.3.1.1 Interpretable Model / Model-Specific

The table below is scored based on the properties specific to the models that were generated based on the algorithms in the notebook. 

**Ex:** GBM scores 0.5 for the Linearity, because, it shows no-linearity as well as linearity as it is usually considered for classification as well as continous distribution problems to address.

Similarly, XGBoost has been scored 0.1 as it shows no leanierity in any aspect, the reason being it to be a tree based model.

| Algorithm/Property | Linearity | Monotonicity | Interaction | Parametric | Transparent | Algorithmic complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logistic Regression** | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| **Gradient Boosting** | 0.5 | 0.7 | 0.7 | 1 | 1 | 0.8 |
| **XGBoost** | 0.1 | 0.4 | 0.7 | 0.9 | 0 | 0.7 |

### 5.3.1.2 Model-Agnostic

| Method/Property | Feature summary | Model internals | Datapoint | A Surrogate intrinsically interpretable model | Expressive power | Portability | Algorithmic complexity | Detailed | Correctness | Consistency | Stability | Certainty | Importance | Novelty | Representativeness |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Variable Importance** | 1 | 1 | 0.5 | / | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0.3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| **PDP** | 1 | 0.1 | 0.9 | / | 1 | 1 | 0.9 | 0.5 | 1 | 0.8 | 1 | 0.8 | 0.8 | 1 | 0.1 |
| **ICE** | 1 | 0.2 | 1 | / | 1 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 1 | 1 | 0.8 | 1 | 0.9 | 1 | 0.9 | 0.1 |

### 5.3.1.3 Human-friendly Explanation

| Model/Property | Contrastiveness | Selectivity | Social | Focus on the abnormal | Truthful | Consistent with prior beliefs of the explainer | General and probable |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Churn** | 0 | 1 | 0.5 | 0.3 | 0.8 | 0.1 | 0.8 |
