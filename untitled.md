# 1. Abstract

This book contains the introductions and explanation to Interpretable models, listing out their definitions and methods, following which we have introduced a structure for an evaluation system for evaluating the interpretable models. The evaluation systems are a metric system to score the interpretable models based on various properties and explanations that can be provided using it. Further, we have explained why a user will be like to choose amongst the given metric system with how to choose them. This follows with an explanation of how the evaluation system would be benefited under the realm of Interpretability system. 

This is a research idea and is still under observation and experiment to see how the system can be perfected and further standardized for supporting the model interpretability, and help them evaluate the same for better interpretation.
