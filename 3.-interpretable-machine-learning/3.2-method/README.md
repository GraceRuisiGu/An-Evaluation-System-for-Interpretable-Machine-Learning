# 3.2 Method

We have methods listed below to proceed with. Below are the methods, that diverge under the Interpretable Machine Learning

* Machine Learning Models
* Model-Agnostic
* Sample Theory

**Machine Learning Models** - will be helping us with some specific algorithm to build the interpretable models and start work with it and also help us explain the working

**Model-Agnostic** - Separating the explanations from the machine learning model \(= model-agnostic interpretation methods\) has some advantages, and we are going to discuss it in this specific section

**Sample Theory** - Is not related to the model interpretability, but a research topic that would help us increase the computational speed to achieve our goal for interpretation and dealing with huge data to build interpretable models. This is just a supporting method for our book, and should not be considered important for an Evaluation System methods.
