# 3.2.3 Sample Theory

**Sampling Distributions**

Sampling distributions describe the distribution for a specific statistic. That is, sampling distributions are a subset \(sample\) of the full data set, with which you can play, explore, and simulate statistics like averages, variance, and skew.

_**Sampling distributions help us create conclusions using the statistics about a population. A sample population is the statistical representation of the actual population.**_  
Before we dive into what and how to do sampling, let's understand a few key terms, that would help us calculate samples.

**I. Confidence Interval**  
Confidence intervals are ‘intervals’ that we can create to guess with a certain degree of accuracy where a parameter of interest lies.

Confidence Interval Width: The distance between the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval.

**II. Method & Formula for Sampling**

In the real world, working with an entire population's data can be slow and heavy, but we can use sampling distributions to estimate what a population parameter most probably is. The general process is as follows:

* Get your data
* Figure out what you want to estimate\(ex. Binary Classification/Regression\)
* Bootstrap that parameter
* Create Confidence intervals.

It depends on the type of problem you want to address based on the distribution of the target on which the model is being built to predict.

* Binary
* Multivariate
* Continuous

**Binary:**

For the other distributions, we use the Rule of thumb for minimum sample size  
**Multivariate:** n &gt;= 100 + 50k  
**Regression:** n &gt;= 104 + k  
_Note: Where k is the number of the independent variable_

**III. Implementation - Python function**  
We created our own function: 

**Assumptions:**

* Error% = **1%**  
* Confidence Interval = **95%**
* z = **1.95**

**IV. Sampling Theorem Script:**

We have used the [**H2O** ](https://www.h2o.ai/)library to operate and test the sampling to help us with the Interpretability and Evaluations of the Interpretable Models.
