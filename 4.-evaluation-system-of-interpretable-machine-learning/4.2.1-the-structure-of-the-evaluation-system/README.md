# 4.2 The Structure of the Evaluation System

The evaluation of interpretable machine learning can be distinguished by restricting the complexity of the machine learning model or by applying methods that analyze the model after training. Therefore, most of the evaluation system evaluates the interpretable machine learning model by two criteria. One is the evaluation of the interpretability of intrinsically interpretable models, the other is the interpretability of model-agnostic. But we think the human explanations are equally important as the first two criteria, which is how to use language or diagram to present or explain the model-specific and model-agnostic methods. Under each criterion, we have lists of keywords on different perspectives which we will introduce to you in this chapter.
